Tonight's Lecture: Programming

- The bare minimum to run software is a processor and some memory
- 56% of embedded systems engineers use c, 22% use c++
	- We're going to use c
	
Compilation process
	Preprocessor
		basically evaluates the #include lines, and processes macros
	Compiler than converts the preprocessed source code into machine code
	Embedded development often uses cross compilers for development
	Linker combines compiler and the processer.
	
We need to insure that our variables are always the same size
	Use the u_int library in order to do this.
		
Scopes in programming
	where the variable is defined
	Local
	File
	Global
