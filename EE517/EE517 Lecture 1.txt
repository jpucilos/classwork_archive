DARPA, Turing, etc.

Alan's Turing Machine
	Tape was used for long term storage of info, besides print
	Put symbols on tapes, feed it through scanner
	Scanner determines symbol, sends it to be interpreted
	Might be worth looking up what a turing machine actually is,
		pretty much all computering machines are Turing

Turing possible father of computer architecture

1945
	Vacuum tubes, each stores a symbol
	Best way to transfer data at the time

1970
	Bell Labs
	someone call Ackland
	John Bardeen or something
		Transistors
		Second nobel prize for Transistor
		greatly reduce size of computer
	Shockley
		seriously someone call Ackland
		wafer level, microprocessors
		Intel - missiles, ships, aircraft etc.
	
1980
	Personal Computer - Bill Gates
	
1990
	Intel is the big guy on campus
	Hardware -> Software (BIOS today) -> Operating system
	C.I.S.C - Complex Instruction Set Computing
		6000+ instructions 
	R.I.S.C - Reduced Instruction Set Computing
		150- instructions
	Stored Program Model
		Alright this is just Embedded Systems is it not?
