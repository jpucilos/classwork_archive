EE 517 Lecture 3

Review RISC
	1. Reduced number of opcodes
	2. Functional units (helping hands)
	3. Separation of data memory and instruction memory
	4. Standard 4-bytes
	5. All data needed by be within the register before execution
	
Structual Hazard - most prominent one results from accessing memory
	- To solve this, RISC separates data memory and instruction memory.
	
Data Hazard
	- can happen because of pipelining
	
Fetch - you don't know the instruction
Decode - you read the instruction

Program Counter - fetches the next location of the net instruction
