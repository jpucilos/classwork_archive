// Lecture 3

Review RISC
	1. Reduced number of opcodes
	2. Functional units (helping hands)
	3. Separation of data memory and instruction memory
	4. Standard 4-bytes
	5. All data needed by be within the register before execution
	
Structual Hazard - most prominent one results from accessing memory
	- To solve this, RISC separates data memory and instruction memory.
	
Data Hazard
	- you know this
	
Fetch - you don't know the instruction
Decode - you read the instruction

Program Counter - fetches the next location of the net instruction

Control Hazard
	- you don't know this
	- the lecture ended, you may never know
