## Classwork Archive

This is where I store my lecture notes/ past homework assignments/ course materials for courses I've taken in the past, as well as links to other github repositories for those classes, if they exist.

Currently the classes are:
CPE 555 - Real-Time and Embedded Systems
CPE 593 - Applied Data Structures and Algorithms
EE 553 - Engineering C++
EE 517 - Digital and Computational Architecture
